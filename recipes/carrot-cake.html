    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vegetable oil until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the grated carrots, crushed pineapple, and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well combined. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, spread a layer of cream cheese frosting over the top of one cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Decorate the cake with additional chopped pecans or a sprinkle of cinnamon for a decorative touch.</li>
            <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy the heavenly goodness of this classic carrot cake with friends and family.</li>
        </ol>
