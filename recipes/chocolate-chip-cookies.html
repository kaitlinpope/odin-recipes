        <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each cookie for spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Serve these delectable chocolate chip cookies warm or at room temperature, and watch as they disappear in a flurry of delight with every irresistible bite.</li>
        <li>Store any leftovers (if there are any!) in an airtight container at room temperature for up to several days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ol>
